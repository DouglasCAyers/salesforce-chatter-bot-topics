Salesforce Chatter Bot for Topics
=========================

Overview
----------------
Chatter Bot for Topics is a way to easily listen for topic assignments to a Chatter post and take action.
An example would be to automatically create a Case when a topic is assigned to a Chatter post.
Unfortunately, you cannot just leverage Process Builder to monitor the creation of a TopicAssignment object.
This project makes it easy by monitoring the topics that you want and then creating a custom object that you can leverage within Process Builder.
